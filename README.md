### üß†‚ú® Introduction
Brain-to-Text '25 is shaping up to be one of the most exciting frontiers in neural interface technology. Here's a breakdown of the latest developments and what they mean for the future of thought-to-text communication:

### üß¨ What Is Brain-to-Text '25?
It refers to a wave of innovations in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) that decode inner speech‚Äîyour silent thoughts‚Äîinto written text. These systems are being developed to help people with paralysis or speech impairments communicate more naturally and rapidly.

### üîç Key Highlights from 2025 Research
- Stanford‚Äôs Breakthrough: Researchers implanted microelectrodes into the motor cortex of patients with severe paralysis. They trained AI models to decode imagined speech with up to 74% accuracy, using a vocabulary of 125,000 words.
- Mental Passwords for Privacy: To prevent accidental decoding, the system activates only when users think a preset phrase like ‚ÄúChitty Chitty Bang Bang‚Äù, which it recognizes with 98% accuracy.
- Meta‚Äôs Brain2Qwerty: Meta developed a non-invasive BCI using EEG and MEG to decode brain signals while users type. It uses a hybrid deep-learning model combining CNNs, transformers, and language models to predict text with up to 80% accuracy.

### üß† Why It Matters
- Empowerment: These systems could revolutionize communication for people with ALS, stroke, or locked-in syndrome.
- Speed & Comfort: Imagined speech is less tiring than attempted speech, making it more sustainable for long-term use.
- Privacy-Aware Design: Mental passwords and activation cues help ensure users retain control over what gets decoded.
